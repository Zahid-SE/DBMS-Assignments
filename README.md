“Home Services” is an online company that helps people find trusted helpers in their locality.
Over 1000 helpers of different categories are registered at the company. The company currently
provides the home services of Cleaning, Laundry, Dish Washing, Cooking, Care Takers,
Plumbers and Electricians etc. All the services are divided into two types: Per Hour service and
Per Task Service. The wages and the time slots vary from service to service. The client and
helper both pay 10% of the wage decided by the company. The company has two types of
users: Clients and Helpers.
The clients and helpers both are verified by the NADRA. In the verification process, both users
will their personal information like CNIC and property documents, etc. The company will store
skills, rates, and preferable time slots for helpers. One helper can provide many services like a
maid can clean, cook, and take care of a baby at home. When a client approaches the company
to book a helper, the company gives two to three options meeting the client’s requirements near
his/her locality. The client can choose the best option of helper. Meanwhile, consent of the
helper is also taken. One client can hire many helpers of different categories and one helper can
work with many clients at a time. Once the selection is done, the company, client, and helpers
sign an agreement containing the all terms & conditions. Both the Client and Helper provide
feedback about each other to the company to help others in selection.
The manager of the company needs to review the accessible components of the system like
Agreements, Feedback Report, Helpers Report, and Client Report.
